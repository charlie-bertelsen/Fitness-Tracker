### Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end pipeline that tracks and analyzes personal fitness, nutrition, and wellness data. It extracts data from wearable exports .csv files, transforms it using Python, stores it in a MySQL database, and visualizes trends through Power BI dashboards.

### Data Sources

The data in this project is sourced from Garmin Connect and Cronometer. Both of these apps allow for .csv data export which I run through the ETL process, sorting the .csv files and uploading them to my fitness tracker database.

Garmin connect is an app that stores the fitness data collected by my garmin watch that I have been wearing consistently to track my progress. The information collected by the garmin includes my sleep, workout, heart rate, stress, weight and more. Cronometer is the nutrition tracking app that I use to enter in every single calorie and nutrient that I have been consuming. Cronometer details all information pertaining to nutrition including calories consumed, primary macronutrients, amino acids, minerals and vitamins.
